Arizona Election Precinct Shapefiles

Election shapefiles used by the 15 different counties in 20012, 2016, 2018, and 2022. 

Some Notes:

* I'm still on the hunt for the 2014 precincts. 
* There should be no changes in precincts between 2018 and 2020 since the boundaries were sent to the US Census Department for redistricting purposes.
* The precinct code is my own. I add an acronym for the county and then padd the precinct number the the left four zeroes. Some of the files are not fully processed since they were just acquired.
  * AP: Apache
  * CH: Cochise
  * CN: Coconino
  * GI: Gila
  * GM: Graham
  * GN: Greenlee
  * LP: La Paz
  * MC: Maricopa
  * MO: Mohave
  * NA: Navajo
  * PN: Pinal
  * PM: Pima
  * SC: Santa Cruz
  * YA: Yavapai
  * YU: Yuma
 * The 2012 precinct file is from the U.S. Census and follows their naming conventions.
 * The 2016 precinct file is from MIT Election Labs. It includes my precinct identifier, but contests from 2016 have been attached.
